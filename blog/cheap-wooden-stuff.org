This Christmas I got myself a miter saw for cutting wooden slats. My girlfriend
was afraid that I could cut a couple of fingers so I had to buy a manual one and
not a cool one (an electric one). I'll leave here a [[https://www.amazon.it/Peugeot-ENERGYSaw-550-Sega-troncatrice-manuale/dp/B00CA7TV2E/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_it_IT=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=54USUEOHJA3X&keywords=sega+troncatrice+manuale+per+legno&qid=1674317634&sprefix=sega+troncatrice+manuale+per+legno%2Caps%2C120&sr=8-1][link]] to the one that I
bought, I noticed that the price has slightly grown.

Anyway, with this super gear I decided to test my woodcraft skills and I made a
couple of things that turned out to be actually quite good looking for my first
experience with wood. 

* First attempt
The first experiment was a simple hexagonal container for my keys because I
noticed that I put them always in the same place but that they seemed quite
messy to me without a proper accomodation.

Although there are some minor details that do not convince me (I had to use some
wood filler to cover some imprecisions in my cuts) I'm happy with the overall
results. And so are my keys as you can see from the picture.

* Christmas Treeangles
The second experiment derives from the fact that I hate thinking about gift and
going shopping for buying gifts. For this reason I decided to gift my family and
my relatives with an hand made wooden Christmas tree.

I saw many ideas on the web but I decide to go simple here and to approximate
the tree as an acute angled isosceles triangle.

The procedure here was a bit more tricky than the key container. The hexagon has
a simple internal angle of 120 deg so I had to cut the border at 60 deg and it
was quite simple. However my saw can cut only from 45 to 90 degrees, so I wasn't
free to choose any angle for my shape. After making some ugly hand sketches I
decide to go full power and make a simple CAD project using the open source
software [[https://www.freecadweb.org/][FreeCAD]] so that I could parametrize the various angles and see preview
of the "tree".

After doing some calculation on how optimize the wood I had to buy I decided to
go with the measurements you see in the picture and It was easier because I had
to cut at 67.5 and 45 degrees that are preconfigured cuts on my saw.

After all the cutting and the assembling using simple wood glue I painted them
with wood impregnator to add more color. Finally I decided to give the
treeangles (notice the word pun) a more christmassy touch by adding some led
lights.

Here is the result. I had to make 8 of these trees, in the end maybe I regret
not going shopping for gifts like everyone else.
