* Hosting on a budget

I was wondering on how I could easily put this website online without having to
pay for services that I basically don't use. Even with the cheapest plan hosting
providers give their custumers additional features like databases and email
addresses which I don't plan to use.

That's when I discovered that Github lets any user build a repository named and
use it as container for its website, hosting it directly with Github Pages. If
you have a Github free plan you must make this repository public while if you
are a payer user you can choose to make it private.

From the moment that all the html pages on my website are public available as a
website I really don't mind making them available as org files in a
repository. Beside this whole project is on a budget so free is cheaper than
paid, am I wrong?

* Hosting is good but the domain name?

Github Pages gives your website a domain name that is ~username.github.io~ which
is not what I wanted for my website domain name.

If you purchase (for one year) a domain from a Registrar service you can use
configure your domain DNS to point to your Github Pages website and that's what
I've done.

The domain of this site costs me 12 euro per year and is the only expense that I
have currently to cover for this project that consists only in HTML
pages. Pretty cheap in my opinion.

* How to do the same

The first step is to create a repository on Github named
~yourusername.github.io~, in my case ~francescopozzoni.github.io~.

Then, for the sake of example, you can create a simple html webpage.

#+begin_src bash
  # clone repo locally
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourusername.github.io

  # create the index.html file
  cd yourusername.github.io
  echo "<html><body>Hello, World!</body></html>" > index.html

  # push the first page on Github
  git add .
  git commit -m "First commit"
  git push -u origin main
#+end_src

Now by navigating https://yourusername.github.io you should see your ~Hello,
World!~ page.

We now need to purchase a domain and tell Google Domains to point to the the
Github Pages repository. I will not cover here how to buy the domain as the
procedure is pretty straighforward to do using the Google Domain platform so
we'll move straight forward to the point process.

We need to add 4 records of type A (note that the host name is left blank) with
the following ip addresses in the data field:
- ~185.199.108.153~
- ~185.199.109.153~
- ~185.199.110.153~
- ~185.199.111.153~

And one record of type CNAME where the hostname needs to be ~www~. After
clicking on save we need to wait at least one hour before the DNS correctly
propagates.

We can check this by running the ~dig~ terminal command.

#+begin_src sh
  dig domainname.domainextension +noall +answer -t A
#+end_src

This is the expected output after the DNS propagates correctly.

#+begin_src
domainname.domainextension.	3600	IN	A	185.199.109.153
domainname.domainextension.	3600	IN	A	185.199.110.153
domainname.domainextension.	3600	IN	A	185.199.111.153
domainname.domainextension.	3600	IN	A	185.199.108.153
#+end_src

We can now go in the settings of the Github repository, in the Pages section and
add our ~domainname~ in the Custom domain. I highly recommend to flag the
enforce HTTPS flag as the connection is made secure in this way.

After clicking on Save Github will do his checks. Done! After completing them
you should be able to access your ~Hello, World!~ page by opening any web
browser and typing your ~domainname.domainextension~.
